## General Info

This week's challenge involves a very important aspect of web development: accessibility.

The main objective for this challenge is to view the structure of the HTML elements and see if these elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning. If any of these elements are out of line, adjust them accordingly so this webpage meets acceibility standards, ie. accessible alt/heading attributes (in sequential order) and concise titling and or commenting.
